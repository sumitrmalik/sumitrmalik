# [Sumit Malik](https://linkedin.com/in/sumit-r-malik/)

DevOps Engineer, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, and Infrastructure Automation enthusiast. I specialize in building resilient cloud architectures with a heavy focus on AWS, Kubernetes, and high-availability systems. 

I am driven by operational excellence because I believe every deployment should be faster, safer, and more cost-effective than the last. 

I bridge the gap between complex infrastructure and seamless delivery.
